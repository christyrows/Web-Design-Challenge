## Four visualization pages, each with:
-A descriptive title and heading tag.
-The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
-A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
## A "Comparisons" page that:
-Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them. *Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
## A "Data" page that:
-Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
## The website has at the top of every page a navigation menu that:
-Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
-Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
-Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
-Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).
